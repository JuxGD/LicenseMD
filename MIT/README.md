# MIT License

Changes I made to the MIT license:

- Added "# " in front of "MIT License"
- Added "##### " in front of "Copyright Â© <YEAR> <COPYRIGHT HOLDER>"
- Changed "<YEAR> <COPYRIGHT HOLDER>" to "`<year>` `<copyright holder>`" (see raw)
- Added "- " in front of "The above copyright notice..."
- Made "AS IS" clause bold
